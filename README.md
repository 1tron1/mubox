Repositiory for the Open Cosmic Ray Telescope
The Î¼box software powers the Open Cosmic Ray telescope, which is a project that detects subatomic particles from terraradiation
and that of space and will map it. The goal of the project is to create a global network which will map the radiation received
from space, by dampening that which is received from local sources(of the Earth).
